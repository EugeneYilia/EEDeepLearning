/**
 * NoveltyEvaluator
 * 
 * Often also called 'Mean Self-Information' or Surprisal
 * 
 * Look at Section '4.2.5 Novelty' of article:
 * 
 * Javari, Amin, and Mahdi Jalili. "A probabilistic model to resolve
 * diversityâ€“accuracy challenge of recommendation systems." Knowledge and
 * Information Systems 44.3 (2015): 609-627.
 * 
 * 
 * Calculates Self-Information of each recommender result list. And then
 * calculates the average of this of all result lists in test set.
 * 
 * But please take also attention to the assumed probability space:
 * 
 * The probability of an item is assumed to be the purchase probability.
 * (Estimated by items purchased divided by all items purchased.) Surely there
 * is also independence assumed between items.
 * 
 * This assumption about the probability space is different from the
 * EntropyEvaluator
